### MINI DESCRIPTION (PUBLICATIONS)
Creation of a solution for an application using Natural Language for awareness of the preservation of natural means / resources

### COMPANY
**SKZ Oberle LTDA**

#### BRIEF COMPANY DESCRIPTION / MINI BIO
SKZ Oberle is the fusion of the tradition and excellence of the consolidated Oberle Contabilidade and Grupo SKZ Contabilidade, totaling more than 80 years of market experience. We act as a hub of corporate solutions, offering integrated services in accounting, financial BPO, tax consulting and much more.

**Supervising Professor:** HERMANO PEIXOTO

## OVERVIEW

**MAIN BUSINESS AREA:** Services

**PROJECT LEADER:** (Fabio Oberle – Commercial Director)

**BACKUP FOCAL POINT:** (Paulo Ricardo – Developer)

**TECHNICAL LEADER:** (Kaic Fachinetti – Developer)

**BUSINESS LEADER:** (Ricardo Evangelista – Data Analyst)

**EXECUTIVE LEADER [Executive Onboarding]:** (Alexandre Tamura – IT Director)

## PROJECT OUTLINE

### PROBLEM
SKZ Oberle currently lacks a unified and accessible data infrastructure that enables fast, traceable, and secure access to accounting, tax, and financial information. Data is fragmented across multiple sources — ERP systems, SQL databases, spreadsheets, and manual files, which hinders the creation of analytical solutions, automations, and any future integration with conversational AI tools.

### OBJECTIVE
Establish a robust corporate data platform for SKZ Oberle by integrating, organizing, and centralizing accounting, tax, and financial data. The goal is to build a structured, secure, and auditable foundation that allows efficient internal data consumption and prepares the organization for the future implementation of a natural language–based AI financial assistant.

### EXPECTED BENEFITS FOR THE PARTNER

Building a governed corporate data layer that enables:

- Automated data ingestion from multiple sources (ERPs, SQL databases, spreadsheets).
- Data organization, cleaning, standardization, and enrichment.
- Centralized storage in a Data Lake or Data Warehouse.
- Data availability through APIs, data views, or query tools.
- Implementation of security, access control, and traceability policies.

### ATTACHED STUDY MATERIALS

#### SHORT PROJECT DESCRIPTION
**Data Foundation Project for SKZ Oberle's Financial Assistant**

#### MACRO SCOPE
The Big Data pipeline can be executed in the following scenario:

Develop and implement SKZ Oberle's first Big Data pipeline, designed to integrate, transform, organize, and make accounting, tax, and financial data available in a centralized, scalable, and auditable environment.

The project includes:

- Consolidating key data sources (ERP, SQL databases, spreadsheets) into a unified storage environment (Data Lake or Data Warehouse).
- Creating ingestion, transformation, and data exposure processes to support future analytical and AI-driven initiatives.
- Ensuring data security, traceability, and governance across all processes.

#### MVP
Deliver the first version of the Big Data pipeline, integrating and centralizing SKZ Oberle's main accounting, tax, and financial data. The MVP will ensure automated ingestion, structured storage, and controlled access, forming the foundation for future artificial intelligence and natural language solutions.

**Infrastructure Note:**
While SKZ Oberle currently uses some Azure resources, the company does not yet have a dedicated data infrastructure.

### REQUIRED INFRASTRUCTURE
The project must run in a Dockerized environment or on a machine capable of running Docker containers.

Infrastructure resources may be provided by the partner, as defined in the TAPI (Technical-Academic Project Integration) documentation.

If the project relies on partner infrastructure, all development will take place at Inteli's facilities, ensuring full access for faculty, coordinators, and students.

## RESTRICTIONS / THE PROJECT DOES NOT COVER

- Integrations will be limited to systems and services explicitly mentioned in the project objectives.
- Advanced data processing or analysis beyond descriptive statistics (e.g., neural networks, machine learning) is out of scope.
- No front-end or dashboard environments will be developed for pipeline visualization.
- Complementary analytical reports will not be produced beyond the required infographic.
- External data access or public APIs are not included in this phase.

## PREMISES

- The project must be completed within 70 calendar days (10 weeks).
- A dataset of at least 1 GB will be simulated by Inteli based on the data structures provided by the partner.
- The statistical analysis results will be validated with the partner before the creation of the infographic.

## Deliverables (Artifacts)

- **Sprint 1** – User understanding and business understanding
- **Sprint 2** – Data ingestion system
- **Sprint 3** – Datalake or Data Warehouse
- **Sprint 4** – Statistical analysis without refinement
- **Sprint 5** – Infographic from statistical analysis

## RESTRICTED CONTENT
A sample of data from our ERP will be sent as soon as we populate the test data.
